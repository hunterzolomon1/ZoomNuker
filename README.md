# How to Install:

first you need to run "install.bat"

now this program checks if you have the required node modules installed or if there's a package.json file in your folder
if no package.json was found it will bring you here

all you have to do is just to press enter twice and after that you can open the installer batch file again
after you do that it will start to check if you have the packages downloaded (again)
and if you have none of them it will download them one by one
